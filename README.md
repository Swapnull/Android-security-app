##Overview
This is a camera application written using the Android SDK. We built it to meet a specification given to us by a 'client' for a university project.

###How it works
The camera runs through an android phones 2.1 and later. A preview of what the camera is pointing at is given and when the start button is pressed, the phone starts to listen to for a phone call. 

When a phone call comes in, the phone takes a photo and uploads it on to a specified server. The app will only ever store one image on your phone, that is the most recent one. 

The app will keep listening for an incoming call until the stop service button is pressed.
